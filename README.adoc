# ScalaCS

ScalaCS (or SCalacS if you prefer) is a library of computer science data structures and algorithms implemented in the Scala programming language.

This project aims to provide practical implementations of various data structures and algorithms across different areas of computer science. The goal is to offer a useful and understandable resource for Scala developers, without necessarily focusing on absolute peak performance or purely functional paradigms.
